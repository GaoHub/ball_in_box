##Tasks
* Firstly, users can randomly input the number of circles, the numbers of blocks and the direct position of each block.
* Secondly,  the algorithm can solve the problem to finding the proper X-axis,,Y-axis,radius to make the sum of the areas of circles biggest.
* Thirdly, calculate the sum of the areas of the circles.
* Finally, output the result of the sum.
